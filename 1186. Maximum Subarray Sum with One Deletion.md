# 1186. Maximum Subarray Sum with One Deletion

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray-sum-with-one-deletion/

[53. Maximum Subarray](53.%20Maximum%20Subarray.md) is the prerequisite to understand this solution.

Let

- `S0(n)` be the set of all subarrays ending at index n, without deletion. Same as `S(n)` in Problem 53.
- `S1(n)` be the set of all subarrays ending at index n (before deletion), with **at most** one deletion.
	- `S0(0)` is a subset of `S1(n)`
- `P0(n)` be the max sum of all subarrays in `S0(n)`. It can be obtained in the same approach as in Problem 53.
- `P1(n)` be the max sum of all subarrays in `S1(n)`.

Here, we want to establish a recurrence relation from `P1(n)` to `P0(n-1)`, `P0(n)` and `P1(n-1)`.

We can classify subarrays in `S1(n)` into 3 categories:

1. The index of deleted item is n. All subarrays in this case belong to `S0(n-1)`, since there must be no deletion in the subarray `arr[i..n-1]`.
2. The index of deleted item is before n. Any subarray in this case can be obtained by combining some subarray in `S1(n-1)` and `arr[n]`.
3. No deletion. Same as `P0(n)`.

Given above, we have the recurrence relation as below:

```
P1(n) = max(P0(n-1), P1(n-1) + arr[n], P0(n))
```

```py
class Solution:
    def maximumSum(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        P0 = arr[:]
        P1 = arr[:]
        for n in range(1, len(arr)):
            P0[n] = max(P0[n-1] + arr[n], arr[n])
            P1[n] = max(P0[n-1], P1[n-1] + arr[n], P0[n])
        return max(P1)
```

Optimization is left to the reader.

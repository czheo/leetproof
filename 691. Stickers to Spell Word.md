# 691. Stickers to Spell Word

https://leetcode.com/problems/stickers-to-spell-word/

People tend to come up with a greedy algorithm at a first glance: first pick the sticker that has the most letters in common with the target.

Let us first this greedy algorithm does not work.

Consider we have `stickers = ["abcd", "abe", "cdf"]` and `target = "abcdef"`.
By greedy, we will pick `"abcd"` first because it has the most letters that is also in the target.
Then you will pick both `"abe"` and `"cdf"` to spell out the target.
However, as the optimal solution, picking `"abe"` and `"cdf"` is already enough.

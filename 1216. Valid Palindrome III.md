# 1216. Valid Palindrome III

https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome-iii/description/

This is a counterpart question of [516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence.md](516.%20Longest%20Palindromic%20Subsequence.md).

Given the lenghth of the string is `l`, if we could find the length of Longest Palindromic Subsequence `p`, it means we at least need to delete `l - p` chars to get a palindrom.
Then we only need to check `l - p <= k` to answer if a string can be transformed into a palindrome by removing at most k characters from it.

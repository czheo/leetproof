# LeetProof

Many online articles give a basic idea of why leetcode solutions work. But sometimes, we need more than just a basic idea. Proofs can help us understand better. However, detailed formal proofs can be hard to follow and might slow us down. So we try to find a middle way. We won't give super detailed proofs, but we'll help you understand both the 'why' and the 'how' of each solution in a clearer way hopefully.

# LeetProof

Many online articles give a basic idea of why leetcode solutions work. But sometimes, we need more than just a basic idea. Proofs can help us understand better.

We won't give super detailed proofs, but we'll help you understand both the 'why' and the 'how' of each solution in a clearer way.

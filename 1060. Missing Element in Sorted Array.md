1060. Missing Element in Sorted Array
===

https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-element-in-sorted-array/

It should be easy to come up with the idea of binary search but may be challenging to reason the correctness of an implementation.
Let `lo` and `hi` be the starting and end indicies indicating the range for binary search.

**Property:** the total count of missing numbers between `lo` and `hi` is `(nums[hi] - nums[lo]) - (hi - lo)`.

- Explain: `nums[hi] - nums[lo] + 1` is the total count of numbers in the range `[lo .. hi]` and `hi - lo + 1` is the count of numbers existing in that range.
- Example: Given `nums = [3, 5, 7]`, `lo = 0` and `hi = 2`. Count of missing numbers in this range is `7 - 3 - (2 - 0) = 2`, which is `4` and `6`.

By appending `inf` to the end of the array, we can maintain an invariant through out binary search: **missing number `n` must be in the range between `lo` and `hi`.** i.e. `nums[lo] < n < nums[hi]`

1. Base case: initially, `nums[hi] = inf` so the invariant holds.
2. Inductive step: let `mid = (lo + hi) // 2` and the count of missing numbers in the range `[lo .. mid]` be `m`, which is `(nums[mid] - nums[lo]) - (mid - lo)` according to the property above. We will update `lo`, `hi` and `k` on each step of binary search.
    1. if `m >= k`, `n` must be the `k`th missing number in the range `[lo .. mid]`;
    2. Otherwise, `n` must be the `k - m`th missing number in the range `[mid .. hi]`. (update with `k' = k - m`)
3. Termination condition: when `lo = hi - 1`, the search terminates and `n` will be the `k`-th number after `nums[lo]`.

```py
class Solution:
    def missingElement(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.append(inf)
        lo = 0
        hi = len(nums) - 1
        while lo < hi - 1:
            mid = (lo + hi) // 2
            missing = nums[mid] - nums[lo] - (mid - lo)
            if missing >= k:
                hi = mid
            else:
                lo = mid
                k -= missing
        return nums[lo] + k

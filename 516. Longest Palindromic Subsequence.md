516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/

Thinking by DP. Let `lps(i, j)` be the longest palindromic subsequence of the substring `s[i..j]`, `lps(i, j)` be the length of `|lps(i, j)|`. We need to know `|lps(0, |s| - 1)|`

**Lemma 1:** If `s[i] == s[j]`, then `lps(i, j)` must contains `s[i]` and `s[j]`.

Proof by contradiction: assume `t = lps(i, j)` does not contains `s[i]` and `s[j]`, you can attach them to the two ends of `t`.
The resulting string `t'` is also a subsequence of s[i..j] and is also a palindrom. So `t'` is the longest palindromic subsequence, which is longer than `t`. Q.E.D

**Lemma 2:** If `s[i] != s[j]` and `s[i]` is in `lps(i, j)`, then `s[j]` must NOT be in it.

Thus, we have the reccurence relation as below:

```
|lps(i, j)|  | s[i] == s[j] = 2 + |lps(i + 1, j - 1)| // by lemma 1
			   | otherwise    = max(|lps(i, j - 1)|, // by lemma 2
                                  |lps(i + 1, j)|) // s[i] not in lps(i, j)
```

```py
class Solution:
    def longestPalindromeSubseq(self, s: str) -> int:
        @cache
        def lps(i, j):
            if i > j:
                return 0
            if i == j:
                return 1
            if s[i] == s[j]:
                return 2 + lps(i + 1, j - 1)
            return max(lps(i + 1, j), lps(i, j - 1))

        return lps(0, len(s) - 1)
